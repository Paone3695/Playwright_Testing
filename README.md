# Playwright Testing Workspace

This workspace contains JavaScript tasks and exercises focused on loops and Playwright testing.

## Structure

- **Tasks/For_Loop_Tasks/**: JavaScript files demonstrating for loop tasks (e.g., printing numbers, multiplication tables).
- **Tasks/While Loop/**: JavaScript files demonstrating while loop tasks (e.g., even numbers, sums, Playwright repetition).

## How to Use

1. Browse the folders to find example scripts for different loop constructs.
2. Run any `.js` file using Node.js:
	```sh
	node path/to/your/script.js
	```
3. For Playwright-related scripts, ensure Playwright is installed:
	```sh
	npm install playwright
	```
